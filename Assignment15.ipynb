        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Pug (formerly known as Jade) is a template engine for Node.js used to generate HTML on the server side. It lets developers write HTML using a clean, indentation-based syntax instead of verbose HTML tags, and then compiles it into standard HTML before sending it to the browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why developers might prefer Pug over raw HTML:\n",
        "\n",
        "Less code, cleaner syntax\n",
        "Pug removes closing tags and reduces boilerplate, making templates shorter and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic content support\n",
        "You can easily insert variables, conditions, and loops (like if, for, each) directly into the template.\n",

        "Reusable components\n",
        "Features like mixins, includes, and extends help avoid repetition and keep layouts modular.\n",

        "Better maintainability\n",
        "Large server-rendered apps become easier to manage due to structured layouts and reusable blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seamless integration with Express\n",
        "Pug works smoothly with Express.js, making it a popular choice for server-side rendering in Node apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in security features\n",

        "**Question 1: What is a RESTful API? Explain four core principles of RESTful API design and why they are important.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for client applications (like web or mobile apps) to communicate with a server over HTTP using a set of simple, consistent rules. It exposes resources (such as users, orders, or products) through URLs and allows clients to perform operations on them using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four Core Principles of RESTful API Design\n",
        "1. Client–Server Separation\n",
        "\n",
        "The client (frontend) and server (backend) are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The client only handles the user interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The server manages data storage and business logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it’s important:\n",
        "This separation improves scalability and flexibility. You can change the frontend without affecting the backend and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Statelessness\n",
        "\n",
        "Each API request must contain all the information needed to process it. The server does not store client session state between requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it’s important:\n",
        "Statelessness makes APIs easier to scale, debug, and cache, because every request is independent and predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Resource-Based Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a unique URL.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "/users/10\n",
        "\n",
        "/orders/45\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP methods define actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET → read\n",
        "\n",
        "POST → create\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT/PATCH → update\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE → remove\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it’s important:\n",
        "This keeps APIs clean, intuitive, and consistent, making them easier for developers to understand and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use of Standard HTTP Methods and Status Codes\n",
        "\n",
        "RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods and response codes like:\n",
        "\n",
        "200 OK\n",
        "\n",
        "201 Created\n",
        "\n",
        "400 Bad Request\n",
        "\n",
        "401 Unauthorized\n",
        "\n",
        "404 Not Found\n",
        "\n",
        "500 Internal Server Error\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it’s important:\n",
        "Using standards ensures predictable behavior and better interoperability across different systems and clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2: Write Express.js routes for a users resource supporting create, read (all and by id), update, and delete operations.**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Passport.js is an authentication middleware for Node.js that simplifies handling authentication in Express applications. It provides a flexible framework to authenticate users using different strategies such as username/password, JWT, OAuth (Google, Facebook, GitHub), etc., without tying authentication logic directly to application code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of Passport.js in Authentication\n",
        "\n",
        "Acts as a middleware layer between incoming requests and your application logic\n",
        "\n",
        "Handles credential verification using pluggable strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "Manages user authentication state (login sessions or tokens)\n",
        "\n",
        "Keeps authentication logic separate from routes and business code\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it’s important:\n",
        "Passport.js makes authentication modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, especially in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Login Flow Using Username and Password (Local Strategy)\n",
        "1. Client Sends Login Request\n",
        "\n",
        "The user submits their credentials (username/email and password) via a POST request.\n",
        "\n",
        "POST /login\n",
        "Body: { username, password }\n",
        "2. Passport Local Strategy Is Triggered\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In an Express app, Google OAuth login works by redirecting the user to Google for authentication. The user logs in and gives consent. Google then redirects back to the app with an authorization code. Using Passport.js, the server exchanges this code for the user’s profile, creates or finds the user in the database, and establishes a session or issues a token.\n",

        "**Question 5: Compare session-based authentication and token-based (JWT) authentication.When would you use each?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Session-based authentication keeps user state on the server and is suitable for traditional web apps with strong server control. Token-based (JWT) authentication is stateless, stores tokens on the client, and is best for modern APIs, SPAs, and scalable distributed applications.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",

        "SQL/NoSQL injection attacks occur when an attacker inserts malicious queries into user input to manipulate a database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or data deletion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevention technique (Node.js):\n",
        "Use parameterized queries / prepared statements (or ORM query binding) instead of directly concatenating user input into database queries. This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that controls which domains are allowed to access an API. It must be configured because browsers block requests from different origins by default to prevent security risks like data theft.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Next.js is a React framework that provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and better performance out of the box. It is used over plain React because it improves SEO, page load speed, and routing without extra configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "File-based routing (App Router):\n",
        "In Next.js, routes are created automatically using the folder structure inside the app/ directory. Each folder represents a URL path, and a page.js file defines the UI for that route. For example, app/blog/page.js maps to /blog. This makes routing simple, organized, and scalable.\n",

        "**Question 10: Explain dynamic routes, middleware, and one performance feature (Suspense or lazy loading) in Next.js.**\n",

        "\n",
        "Dynamic routes:\n",
        "Dynamic routes in Next.js allow pages to handle variable URL segments using brackets. For example, app/users/[id]/page.js renders pages like /users/1 or /users/5.\n",
        "\n",
        "Middleware:\n",
        "Middleware in Next.js runs before a request is completed and is used for tasks like authentication, authorization, redirects, and logging. It executes at the edge and helps control access to routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance feature (Suspense / lazy loading):\n",

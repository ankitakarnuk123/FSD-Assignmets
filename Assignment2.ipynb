        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that have a meaningful name and purpose, clearly describing the role of the content they contain.\n",
        "They tell both the browser and developers what type of content is inside.\n",
        ".Improves Accessibility\n",
        "\n",
        "Screen readers and assistive technologies use semantic tags to help visually impaired users navigate a website more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)\n",
        "\n",
        "Search engines like Google understand page structure better when semantic tags are used, which helps improve ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Readability & Maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can understand the purpose of elements more easily when reading code, making collaboration and maintenance simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Consistent Structure\n",
        "\n",

        "structure the page, and why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** When structuring a blog page, you’d use semantic HTML elements to make the layout meaningful, accessible, and SEO-friendly. Here’s a typical structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.<header>\n",
        "\n",
        "Placed at the top of the page.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contains the site logo, blog title, and maybe a navigation bar (<nav>).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. <nav>\n",
        "\n",
        "Contains the site’s navigation links (e.g., Home, Categories, About).\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps users and search engines understand the site’s navigation structure.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. <article>\n",
        "\n",
        "Each blog post is an <article> because it is independent content that can stand on its own (shareable, indexable).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. <section>\n",
        "\n",
        "Used to group related content inside an article (e.g., introduction, body, comments).\n",
        "\n",
        "Could also be used for grouping posts (like “Recent Posts” section).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. <aside>\n",
        "\n",
        "For side content, such as author info, ads, related articles, or a category list.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s content related to the main article but not essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. <footer>\n",

        "At the bottom of the page or each article.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To make an HTML form accessible, I’d use semantic input types and associate labels with inputs so screen readers can read them. I’d ensure keyboard navigation works, group related fields with <fieldset> and <legend>, provide clear error messages, and use ARIA attributes when needed. Also, I’d maintain good color contrast and visible focus for users with visual impairments\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4: Identify and correct the errors in the following CSS code:\n",
        "p {\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "I’d use the descendant selector section h2 { color: blue; text-align: center; } to style all <h2> inside <section> with blue color and centered alignment.\n",

        "**Question 6: Explain the CSS box model and its components.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The CSS box model describes how the size of an element is calculated. It has four parts: the content area, padding (space inside the border), border, and margin (space outside the border). The total size includes all of these combined.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 7: How do the relative, absolute, and fixed positioning properties differ in CSS?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Relative positions an element based on its normal spot. Absolute positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor and removes it from the flow. Fixed positions it relative to the viewport and keeps it in place even when scrolling.\n",

        "I’d use .banner { background-image: url('...'); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: center; } to ensure the image covers the entire area without repeating\n"

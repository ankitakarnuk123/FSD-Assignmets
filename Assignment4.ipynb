        "Version control systems like Git track changes in code, allow multiple developers to collaborate without conflicts, and provide history, rollback, and branching for experimentation. They’re essential in modern software development for teamwork, CI/CD, and maintaining reliable, scalable codebases.\n",

        "\n",
        "A .gitignore file tells Git which files/folders not to track, like logs or temporary files. For example, to ignore all log files, we add *.log in .gitignore.\n",

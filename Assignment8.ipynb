        " **Question 1 : What is React?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs), especially single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when data changes, using a virtual DOM for faster performance. React focuses mainly on the view layer (V) in the MVC architecture and can be used with other libraries or frameworks for routing and state management.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2 : Write a React functional component named `Greeting` that accepts a `name` prop and displays: \"Hello, [name]!\".**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "import React from \"react\";\n",
        "\n",
        "function Greeting({ name }) {\n",

        "\n",
        "**Question 3 : What is JSX and why is it useful in React?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, making the code more readable and expressive.\n",
        "\n",
        "JSX is useful because:\n",
        "\n",
        "It makes components easier to understand and visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps detect syntax errors during compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows embedding of JavaScript expressions directly inside markup using {}.\n",
        "\n",
        "It simplifies creating and updating the UI structure dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4 : Explain how props support React’s one-way data flow.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This supports React’s one-way data flow, meaning data moves in a single direction — from parent to child.\n",
        "\n",
        "Child components receive props as read-only values, so they cannot modify the data directly. If changes are needed, the child can call a function passed down as a prop to request the parent to update the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This one-way flow makes the application predictable, easier to debug, and ensures that data changes are controlled and consistent throughout the component tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5 : Create a functional component ClickMeButton that renders a button. It accepts onClick and label props. When clicked, it executes the passed onClick handler.**\n",

        "\n",
        "import React from \"react\";\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "The key attribute in React helps identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. It allows React to efficiently update the DOM by reusing existing elements instead of re-rendering the entire list.\n",
        "\n",
        "If keys are missing or array indexes are misused as keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "React may incorrectly reuse or reorder elements, causing UI bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Component state can get mixed up when list items are added, deleted, or reordered.\n",
        "\n",
